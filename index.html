						We are Tim Schmidt and Charles Moscoe, known online as internet marketers who have generated 
						hundreds of millions of dollars in online sales over the past 2 decades.
					</p>
					<p>
						For the first time ever, we share our secrets in a step-by-step online training course that has been 
						designed specifically for you to beable to follow and replicate with a little hard work, ingenuity and 
						a small amount of capital. Welcome to the club where it all happens,
					</p>
					<p>
						the one and only Earners Group. 
					</p>

						We all know that there is "no such thing as a free lunch", that is why we designed this course for 
						regular but hard working people who are simply underpaid and under appreciated in their current 
						positions and are seeking the financial freedom to be their own boss and looking for that roadmap 
						to success.
					</p>
					<p>
						You do not have to be a genius or have any online experience whatsoever to succeed in the Earners 
						Group. Although this is a course about making money on the internet, you don't have to be an 
						internet or computer expert. You would be surprised to know how LITTLE technical skills we actually 
						have, but that hasn't stopped us from making millions entirely online. Are you a normal person with 
						a bit of intelligence who is simply underperforming in life? If so, we challenge you to take a minute 
						and watch this video below. 
					</p>
					<p>
						How does this all work? Serial entreprenuer Steve Nudelberg explains it best:

						In our comprehensive online training course, you will follow us through an extensive series of videos 
						that explain and demonstrate every single facet about product inception and driving sales. These are 
						the exact same easy-to-learn methods from product sourcing to branding to marketing and selling 
						that we use ourselves. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Recent examples of our success include the development of a daily use skin care product that we 
						launched with only a few thousand dollar investment. We were able to literally transform the idea 
						overnight into one of the hottest anti-aging products in the world, generating over $5 million dollars in 
						online sales for 2013. We will show you how it is done from start to finish with a real life interactive 
						case studies that are immersive as they are educational.

						Inside the Earners Group you will find 200+ hours of interactive video modules, where we will walk 
						you through everything we do. Starting from the thinking process of product conception to getting to 
						market online with a real life and current example chosen specifically for this course. In fact, every 
						facet of the course is detailed step-by-step leaving no stone unturned. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Throughout your training you will have opportunities to have your questions answered by us and be 
						involved in our private webinars where we host think tanks with some of the sharpest minds on the 
						internet who share their own secrets of success. Some of the topics covered in extreme detail in our 
						training course include:

								After being recruited and hired by tech consulting giant 
								Accenture within days of starting his final year of college, 
								Tim shocked the world mere months after graduation 
								and moved to Miami Beach without a job or any semblance 
								of a game plan.  After finding a vague ad on an Internet 
								job forum, he accepted the challenge of making sales 
								calls for a start-up SEO agency that didn’t offer a salary 
								or any long-term job security. From day one, he was the 
								top earning sales consultant and evolved into a role as 
								VP of Business Development.   As an "information sponge," 
								Timlearned the business quickly and began to realize he 
								was helping other entrepreneurs make money from his ideas. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Taking yet another chance, he shocked everyone once 
								again and left the company to go on his own. Since 2003, 
								Tim has successfully launched, operated, built, and sold 
								online businesses of many shapes and sizes.  
								He continues to “practice what he preaches” by owning and 
								operating several e-commerce ventures and occasionally 
								works with companies seeking an overhaul of their digital 
								marketing strategy. Tim was never in “advanced classes.”  
								He had an average ACT score and below average 
								SAT score.  He financed his move and first year in Miami 
								on a credit card. In his early 20’s he was over $60,000 in 
								debt in credit cards alone.  Tim admittedly has “negative 
								tech skills", but he has a desire to EARN.

								Charles is an accomplished entrepreneur who takes 
								pride in the fact that he has never had a real job in his life. 
								He attended York University's prestigious Schulich 
								School of Business on a full scholarship only to drop 
								out with 3 credits remaining because he saw no point 
								in taking business advice from people who he was 
								out earning with his little satellite TV business that 
								later became the focus of an international incident. 
							</p>
							<p>
								As a self-taught e-commerce expert who regularly 
								consults high net-worth clients on website design, 
								product branding and checkout technology, he is a world 
								traveller who routinely works from the comfort of a 
								padded beach chair. He does not own an alarm clock, 
								or a tie, but has golf club memberships in 3 different 
								countries and plays when he wants to on his own 
								schedule with nobody to report to. Absent of a strong 
								work ethic and with an affinity for fine rum and 
								extra-curricular activity, Charles prides himself on his 
								unparalled efficiency and effectiveness. Much of his 
								training revolves around the "work smarter not harder" 
								philosphy that he preaches in the Earners Group course. 
							</p>
							<p>
								This is the same system of guided entrepreneurial spirit
								 that has afforded Charles the flexibility and earning 
								power to be able to live the life that his dreams. He 
								credits a simple but proven system of online marketing 
								as the key to his success. He reveals all of his secrets 
								inside the Earners Group.

						Although we clearly have the funding to invest heavily on the onset of any new business, our 
						specialty is building brands from the ground up on a shoestring budget, one that almost anybody can 
						afford. That is what is so unique about our successes and our teachings, the fact that just 
						about anybody can do it. You don't have to be a millionaire or even be willing to invest a fraction 
						of your savings. What we teach is a low-risk, grassroots approach to building highly profitable 
						internet based businesses. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Although we have been called "geniuses", we really aren't smarter 
						than anybody else. We have just found a logical way to make money on the internet and scaled 
						it into a series of multi-million dollar enterprises that print money. Opportunities are there every 
						day, just like the real live case studies in the course. The great thing about the Earners Group 
						training methods is that once you learn them, they are completely scalable. So potential income is 
						virtually unlimited and just a factor of how hard you want to work. Simply learn the principles, do 
						your first deal, make a small profit, dont quit, keep repeating the successful formula you just learnt 
						over and over and you can become very wealthy. In the past few years we have created a number 
						of successful purepay internet businesses that have been generating us millions of dollars in 
						profits using the exact same fundamental principles that we teach in the Earners Group course.

						Many programs theorize about outsourcing, and we know that it has become a big buzzword. But 
						who actually offers any ideas on how to actually attract the top talent at the best prices? We 
						take out the guesswork for you. This allows you to benefit from our years of experiences of trial 
						and error with countless companies and service providers, as we give you direct access to the 
						ones that we not only recommend, but continue to use ourselves.  
					</p>
					<p>
						If you join the Earners Group today, you will always have current and updated access to the 
						same professional network that we are using to make millions of dollars doing exactly what we are 
						teaching you to do. Our professional network features special Earners Group pricing and you will 
						save big on services ranging from killer web design to a 24-hour order taking call center that we 
						work with ourselves to actual company that pick, pack and fill our hundreds of daily orders. 
						Why special pricing? 
					</p>
					<p>
						Because we have already done the negotiation for you and Earners Group members will benefit 
						from our group discounts. Exclusive access to this vital network of professionals ensures 
						smooth sailing for your future enterprise. Because of the limited capacity that many of the members 
						of our professional network have to take on new clients, we cannot offer this indefinitely. So to take 
						advantage of this limited time special offer, be sure to act quickly as spots are filling up fast 
						and there is simply no way to expand the professional network capacity beyond what it can 
						currently accommodate. Furthermore, Earners Group members receive access to potential 
						funding, partnerships and joint ventures with us and other members in our very own Private Venture 
						Capital Forum. Let us help you build your dream business and share in your prosperity.
